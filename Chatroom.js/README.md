Usage:

Download and install Node.js (found here: https://nodejs.org/download/ )

Using Terminal on mac or a bash like shell for windows
  (We would recommend git bash: http://git-scm.com/downloads)
run: npm install --save express@4.10.2
then run: npm install --save socket.io

Here we are downloading two node.js libraries called express an socket.io

Let's test it out!

If this has worked successfully then run:
node server.js

You should see "listening on localhost:8888" printed in your console of choice

Open up your favorite browser and enter localhost:8888 into the URL bar!
Make a new tab enter the same URL, see what happens when you send messages then!
